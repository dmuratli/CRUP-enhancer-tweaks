# Improving the Predictive Accuracy of CRUP
A suite of tools that allows adjusting CRUP's enhancer predictions and extracting state-specific enhancers. Works with all genomic regions, not just enhancers.

The tools in this repository were developed within the scope of an internship at the Vingron Lab, associated with the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics. See the associated report for details.
